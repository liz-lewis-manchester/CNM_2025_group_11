# Pollutant Transport Model – Quick Run Guide

## Purpose
This code models one-dimensional pollutant transport in a river using an
upwind finite difference advection scheme. It produces plots showing how
pollutant concentration changes with distance and time.

## Requirements
Python 3, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas  
(Google Colab recommended)

## Files
- Python script or notebook
- `initial_conditions.csv` (input data)

## Model Parameters
The model requires the following user-defined parameters:

- t_start (s) – Start time of the simulation (fixed at 0 s)
- t_end (s) – End time of the simulation
- dt (s) – Temporal resolution (time step size)
- dx (m) – Spatial resolution (distance between grid points)
- U (m/s) – Mean flow velocity in the river
- lambda_decay (1/s) – Exponential decay constant controlling how the pollutant input decreases over time
- perturbation_factor (%) – Percentage perturbation applied to the flow velocity to simulate variable stream velocity

Initial concentration data are read from `initial_conditions.csv` and interpolated
onto the model grid.

Numerical stability is enforced using the CFL condition:
C = U·dt / dx ≤ 1  
If violated, dt is automatically adjusted.

## How to Run
1. Open the code in Google Colab or a local Python environment.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. Enter model parameters when prompted (dx, dt, U).
4. Upload `initial_conditions.csv` when requested.
5. Plots are generated automatically.
