# Pollutant Transport Model – Quick Run Guide

## Purpose
This code models one-dimensional pollutant transport in a river using an
upwind finite difference advection scheme. It produces plots showing how
pollutant concentration changes with distance and time.

## Requirements
Python 3, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas  
(Google Colab recommended)

## Files
- Python script or notebook
- `initial_conditions.csv` (input data)

## How to Run
1. Open the code in Google Colab or a local Python environment.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. Enter model parameters when prompted (dx, dt, U).
4. Upload `initial_conditions.csv` when requested.
5. Plots are generated automatically.

## Test Cases

**Test Case 1 – Simple Initial Condition**  
- 20 m domain, dx = 0.2 m, dt = 10 s, U = 0.1 m/s  
- Initial concentration: 250 µg/m³ at x = 0, zero elsewhere  
Expected: pollutant plume advects downstream smoothly.

**Test Case 2 – CSV Initial Conditions**  
- Initial concentrations read from `initial_conditions.csv` and interpolated.  
Expected: interpolated profile moves downstream over time.

**Test Case 3 – Sensitivity Testing**  
- Velocity, spatial resolution, and time step are varied.  
Expected: higher velocity gives faster transport; smaller dx and dt improve accuracy.

## Output
- Plots of concentration versus distance at selected times.
- CFL stability is checked automatically.
