# Pollutant Transport Model – How to Run

## What this code does
This code simulates how a pollutant moves downstream in a river using a
1D advection model solved with an upwind finite difference method.

It produces plots showing pollutant concentration versus distance for
different test cases.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Google Colab (recommended)

## Files needed
- `initial_conditions.csv` (provided in the `data/` folder)
- Python script or notebook containing the model code

## How to run the code
1. Open the notebook or Python script in Google Colab or a local Python environment.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. When prompted, enter the model parameters (dx, dt, U).
4. Upload `initial_conditions.csv` when requested.
5. The code will automatically generate plots for each test case.

## Test Cases and Expected Results

### Test Case 1 – Simple Initial Condition
- Initial concentration: 250 µg/m³ at x = 0, zero elsewhere
- Domain: 20 m
- Resolution: dx = 0.2 m, dt = 10 s
- Velocity: U = 0.1 m/s

Expected result:
- Pollutant plume moves downstream over time
- Peak concentration decreases due to numerical diffusion
- Concentration remains non-negative

### Test Case 2 – CSV Initial Conditions
- Initial concentration read from `initial_conditions.csv`
- Values are interpolated onto the model grid

Expected result:
- Initial concentration profile matches the CSV shape
- Profile advects downstream smoothly over time

### Test Case 3 – Sensitivity Testing
- Model is run multiple times while varying:
  - Velocity U
  - Spatial resolution dx
  - Temporal resolution dt

Expected result:
- Higher U → faster downstream transport
- Smaller dx and dt → smoother and more accurate results
- CFL condition is automatically enforced

## Output
- Plots of concentration vs distance at selected times
- Sensitivity comparison plots
- Figures are displayed automatically and can be saved if required

## Notes
- The CFL stability condition is checked automatically.
- The downstream boundary uses a zero-gradient condition.
- Results may differ slightly depending on chosen resolution.
